Chang'e-6 lunar samples reveal a giant impact reshaped the Moon's interior	A colossal ancient impact may have reshaped the Moon far more deeply than scientists once realized. By analyzing rare lunar rocks brought back by Chinaâ€™s Changâ€™e-6 mission from the Moonâ€™s largest crater, researchers found unusual chemical fingerprints pointing to extreme heat and material loss caused by a giant impact. The collision likely stripped away volatile elements, reshaped volcanic activity, and left a lasting chemical signature deep below the surface.	https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260208011014.htm	ScienceDaily	2/8/2026	https://d2u1z1lopyfwlx.cloudfront.net/thumbnails/0a9b1665-b5fa-521f-aa48-6b00e6f8786f/fb5f86a1-5575-5a53-8c96-194c46332d40.jpg
